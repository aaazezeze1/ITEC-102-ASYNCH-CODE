/* Write a program that applies bonus points to given scores in the range [1â€¦9] by the following rules:
- If the score is between 1 and 3, the program multiplies it by 10.
- If the score is between 4 and 6, the program multiplies it by 100.
- If the score is between 7 and 9, the program multiplies it by 1000.
- If the score is 0 or more than 9, the program prints an error message. */
